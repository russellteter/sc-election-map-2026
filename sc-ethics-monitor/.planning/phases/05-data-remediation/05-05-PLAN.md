# Plan 05-05: Final Sync and Verification

<objective>
Cross-reference all data sources and verify the Google Sheet is now a reliable source of truth.

Purpose: After fixing party detection, race analysis, incumbent data, and running discovery, ensure all data is consistent and verified against known candidate lists like SCHouseMap7.0.

Output: Verified Google Sheet with documented completeness and accuracy metrics.

<task type="auto" id="1">
  <name>Cross-reference SCHouseMap7.0 Democrats</name>
  <action>
    Verify all 35 SCHouseMap7.0 Democratic candidates are in the system:

    | District | Candidate | In Sheet? | Party Correct? |
    |----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
    | 015 | JA Moore | ? | ? |
    | 023 | Chandra Dillard | ? | ? |
    | ... (all 35) | ... | ... | ... |

    Flag any missing or mismatched candidates.

</task>

<task type="auto" id="2">
  <name>Verify Ethics filings match sheet data</name>
  <action>
    For candidates in the Candidates tab:
    1. Verify report_id matches actual Ethics Commission filing
    2. Verify filing_date is accurate
    3. Verify candidate_name matches filing
    4. Verify office matches (House vs Senate, district number)

    Document any discrepancies.

<task type="auto" id="3">
  <name>Identify declared but not filed candidates</name>
  <action>
    Compare discovered candidates to Ethics filings:
    - Candidates from Ballotpedia/SCDP/SCGOP without report_id
    - These have "declared" but not filed with Ethics Commission

    Create list for Research Queue:
    - Candidate name
    - District
    - Source (where declared)
    - Status (needs filing verification)

<task type="auto" id="4">
  <name>Update Research Queue with actionable items</name>
  <action>
    Populate Research Queue with:
    1. Candidates with UNKNOWN party (need web research)
    2. Candidates declared but not filed (need filing verification)
    3. Districts with no candidates (need outreach research)
    4. Conflicts between sources (need manual resolution)

    Set priority and assignment for each item.

<task type="auto" id="5">
  <name>Verify Race Analysis totals</name>
  <action>
    Final verification of Race Analysis:
    1. Sum of all dem_candidates = total D candidates in Candidates tab
    2. Sum of all rep_candidates = total R candidates in Candidates tab
    3. Every district has a race_status value
    4. Every district has incumbent data

    Fix any remaining discrepancies.
  </action>
  <verify>Race Analysis totals match Candidates tab</verify>
  <done>Race Analysis verified consistent</done>

<task type="auto" id="6">
  <name>Generate final completeness report</name>
  <action>
    Create comprehensive report:

    ## Data Completeness
    - Candidates tab: N rows, X% with party, Y% with filing
    - Race Analysis: 170 rows, X% with candidates, Y% with incumbents
    - Districts tab: 170 rows, X% with county, Y% with region
    - Research Queue: N items, priorities distributed

    ## Verification Results
    - SCHouseMap7.0 match: 35/35 (100%)
    - Ethics filing match: X/Y (Z%)
    - Party detection accuracy: X/Y (Z%)

  <name>Document maintenance procedures</name>
  <action>
    Create runbook for ongoing maintenance:

    ## Daily
    - Monitor sync log for errors
    - Review new Ethics filings

    ## Weekly
    - Run candidate discovery pipeline
    - Review Research Queue items
    - Update party-data.json with new information
